# Star Wars Machine Learning Model 

This repo contains the files used to prepare data for and build 
a neural network that developed the ability to distinguish the 
difference between an image of Anakin Skywalker and an image of 
Darth Vader

The file test.py contains the script necessary to test the model,
simply load in the model using the load_model() command from 
keras, and use the images given in the test folder. Additional 
images can be added for additional testing
